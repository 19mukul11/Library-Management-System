        <p>Library Management System is an application software which is used to perform the data management work of a
            library. It is used to simulate the functioning of a Book Library and perform functions like add book
            record, register student, issue book, return book, manage statistics, edit and delete data etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>LMS@SISTec</b> is also a Library Management System. It is a GUI Standalone Desktop Application which
            provides
            the ease to perform various tasks of library without connecting to a network. Yes, it is not a web based
            application, it is standalone to a single machine. It provides a user friendly classic Graphical User
            Interface to interact with database. Since, it is developed in Java, so it is machine independent as it runs
            on JVM.</p>

        <h2>Database (SQLite)</h2>
        <p>SQLite is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) contained in a C library. As compared to many other
            DBMS, SQLite is not a client-server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into end program. SQLite stores
            the entire database as a single cross platform file on a host machine. SQLite library is linked in and thus
            become an integral part of the application program. It is lightweight, easy to use software which does not
            need any installation. It can be easily embedded with the application program.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Java Swing & AWT</h2>
        <p>Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for JAVA. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) - an API for
            providing GUI for Java programs. Swing was developed to provide more sophisticated set of GUI components
            than the AWT. Swing provides a look & feel of several platforms, and also supports pluggable look & feel. It
            has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. It provides some additional components such as tabbed
            panel, scroll panes, trees, tables and lists. In this application, GUI components from Swing are used
            whereas onclick and other dynamic actions (ActionListener, MouseListener, KeyListener) are implemented by
            using AWT.</p>
